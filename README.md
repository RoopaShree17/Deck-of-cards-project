# Deck-of-cards-project
To implement a Deck class that manages a standard 52-card deck, we start by creating a class to represent individual cards, each with a suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) and a value (1 through 13). The Deck class stores these cards in a list and includes methods to shuffle the deck and draw cards. To handle card drawing and sorting, we initialize an ArrayList to store 20 randomly drawn cards from the deck. For sorting the cards, we implement a custom Comparator class. This Comparator sorts the cards based on a three-tier hierarchy: first by color (red cards, which are hearts and diamonds, before black cards, which are spades and clubs), then by suit within each color, and finally by ascending card value. Using the Collections.sort method with our custom Comparator, we can sort the ArrayList according to these criteria, ensuring the cards are ordered first by their color, then by suit within each color, and finally by their numerical value in ascending order. This structured approach ensures efficient management, drawing, and sorting of the cards, adhering to the specified rules and criteria.
